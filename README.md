## Hey! I'm Pepe! ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm a software developer currently working on a personal FullStack project using [React, NextJS & Mongoose] stack!

ðŸŒ± I have worked as a FullStack developer on companies and as a freelancer using multiple technologies, mainly [MongoDB, Express & Node] on the backend and [ReactJS & MithrilJS] on the frontend.

ðŸ¤” I'm really into any kind of programming and always trying to learn about the newest technologies and best coding practices.
